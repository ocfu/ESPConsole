# ESP Console for Arduino Projects
===========================================

This library offers a command console for the ESP8266 (with ESP32 support coming soon) accessible via the serial port (Serial) and a WiFiClient. It provides users with an interactive console for entering commands. Designed to facilitate debugging during the development of Arduino ESP projects, the library also enables remote administration through a Linux shell-like command interface.

The console operates non-blockingly and requires frequent calls within the main loop() function without significant delays to function properly. It includes basic commands for viewing configuration, status, and processing information. Additionally, for projects utilizing a file system (LittleFS), the library provides a set of commands for managing the file system and files.

      - **esp**: show esp status 
      - **net**: show the network setup
      - **ntp**: show the ntp configuration
      - **set**: set configuration items
         - ssid, ssidpw, ntpserver
      - **reset**: factory reset (erase files and all configuration)
   - Implement functionality to add additional command sets.
      - **mqtt**: mqtt configuration 
      - **ha**: home assistant configuration

### Medium Priority

   - [ ] User prompt (Yes/No and further)
   - Commands
      - **set**: set configuration items
         - tz, hostname
- [ ] Improve functionality for Ext features
   - Commands:
      - **uptime**: verfy load and loop time measurements
- [ ] Improve functionality for FS features
   - Commands:
      - **cat**: introduce ">" and ">>" to write inputs from console users
- [ ] Implement further Ext features
   - Commands:
      - **eprom**
- [ ] Refactor code
- [ ] Monitor and minimize of resources (code in flash, heap usage)
- [ ] Test in other environments and up-to-date versions

## üöÄ Upcoming Features
- [ ] Configuration file on FS
- [ ] Logging
   - to file(s)
   - to a log server
   - ...   
- [ ] Process Manager
   - Managing user processes (control and measure times and resources etc.). 
   - New console commands: start, kill, top, ps
   - Console processes (e.g. start heap to continuesly showing heap information until user quits with ctr-c)
   - User processes (in the ino sketh the user can register loops to be managed as a process with start parameter like delayed start, priority, standby, triggered ...)
- [ ] SSH / secured login
