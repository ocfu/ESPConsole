# ESP Console for Arduino Projects
===========================================

This library offers a command console for the ESP8266 (with ESP32 support coming soon) accessible via the serial port (Serial) and a WiFiClient. It provides users with an interactive console for entering commands. Designed to facilitate debugging during the development of Arduino ESP projects, the library also enables remote administration through a Linux shell-like command interface.

The console operates non-blockingly and requires frequent calls within the main loop() function without significant delays to function properly. It includes basic commands for viewing configuration, status, and processing information. Additionally, for projects utilizing a file system (LittleFS), the library provides a set of commands for managing the file system and files.

# Documentation

# Examples
[ESPConsole_min](https://github.com/ocfu/ESPConsole/tree/main/examples/ESPConsole_min)
Bare minimum Arduino example. The ESPConsole library provides a simple command-line terminal interface over the serial port with a minimal set of commands. To reduce the flash memory usage, you can define the compiler macro ESP_CONSOLE_NOWIFI. This will exclude Wi-Fi-specific code during compilation, saving space in the flash.


```cpp
#include "CxESPConsole.hpp"

CxESPConsole ESPConsole(Serial, "Test App", "1.0");

void setup() {
   Serial.begin(115200);
   ESPConsole.begin();
}

void loop() {
   ESPConsole.loop();
}
```

[ESPConsole_min_wifi](https://github.com/ocfu/ESPConsole/tree/main/examples/ESPConsole_min_wifi)
This example offers the same command set as the previous one, but with added remote access capabilities. You can connect a terminal client (e.g., PuTTY) via the defined port 23 to access the same simple command-line terminal interface over the network.

```cpp
#include "CxESPConsole.hpp"

CxESPConsole ESPConsole(Serial, "Test App", "1.0");

WiFiServer server(23);

#ifndef STASSID
#define STASSID "your-ssid"
#define STAPSK "your-password"
#endif

const char* ssid = STASSID;
const char* password = STAPSK;

void setup() {
   Serial.begin(115200);
   WiFi.begin(STASSID, STAPSK);
    
    while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
       delay(500);
       Serial.print(".");
    }
    Serial.println("\nWiFi connected.");
    server.begin();
    
    ESPConsole.begin(server);
}

void loop() {
   ESPConsole.loop();
}
```

      - **net**: show the network setup
      - **ntp**: show the ntp configuration
      - **set**: set configuration items
         - ssid, ssidpw, ntpserver
      - **reset**: factory reset (erase files and all configuration)
   - Implement functionality to add additional command sets.
      - **mqtt**: mqtt configuration 
      - **ha**: home assistant configuration

   - [ ] User prompt (Yes/No and further)
   - Commands
      - **set**: set configuration items
         - tz, hostname
- [ ] Improve functionality for Ext features
   - Commands:
      - **uptime**: verfy load and loop time measurements
- [ ] Improve functionality for FS features
   - Commands:
      - **cat**: introduce ">" and ">>" to write inputs from console users
- [ ] Implement further Ext features
   - Commands:
      - **eprom**

---

## üöÄ Upcoming Features
- [ ] Configuration file on FS
- [ ] Logging
   - to file(s)
   - to a log server
   - ...   
- [ ] Process Manager
   - Managing user processes (control and measure times and resources etc.). 
   - New console commands: start, kill, top, ps
   - Console processes (e.g. start heap to continuesly showing heap information until user quits with ctr-c)
