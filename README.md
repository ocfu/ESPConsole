# ESP Console for Arduino Projects
===========================================

This library offers a command console for the ESP8266 (with ESP32 support in the future) accessible via the serial port (Serial) and a WiFiClient. It provides users with an interactive console for entering commands. Designed to facilitate debugging during the development of Arduino ESP projects, the library also enables remote administration through a Linux shell-like command interface.

The console operates non-blockingly and requires frequent calls within the main loop() function without significant delays to function properly. It includes basic commands for viewing configuration, status, and processing information. Additionally, for projects utilizing a file system (LittleFS), the library provides a set of commands for managing the file system and files.

Enter ? to get help. Have a nice day :-)

## Terminal
The output of the console is formated and controlled by using ESC sequences. Your used terminal should support this (e.g. PuTTY).

## Command Sets

| Command Set  | Commands        |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Bare minimum | ?, reboot, cls, info, uptime, time, exit, date, users, heap, hostname, ip, ssid, hw, sw |
| Extended     | flash, esp   | 
| Filesystem   | du, df, size, ls, cat, cp, rm, touch, mount, umount, format |

More and description to come.

## Compiler options

| Macro | Description |
|-------|-------------|
|`ESP_CONSOLE_NOWIFI`| exclude Wi-Fi-specific code |
|`ARDUINO_CLI_VER=<MMmmPP>`| (optional) Unfortunately Arduino CLI does not provide any (reliable) compiler macro indicating the used version. This marcro defines it manually, only for the benefit of the command `sw`, which shows relevant version info.

The library is developed using XCode and Arduino CLI. For testing purpose, there are code segments, only for the use in this test environment and Arduino specific code is framed by ```#ifdef ARDUINO ... #endif```. 
 
## Example Arduino CLI compiler call
```bash
arduino-cli compile -b esp8266:esp8266:nodemcuv2:eesz=4M1M,led=2 --clean --output-dir build/esp8266.esp8266.nodemcuv2  --export-binaries --build-property build.extra_flags="-DESP_CONSOLE_NOWIFI -DARDUINO_CLI_VER=2900 "
```


# Examples
[ESPConsole_min](https://github.com/ocfu/ESPConsole/tree/main/examples/ESPConsole_min)
Bare minimum Arduino example. The ESPConsole library provides a simple command-line terminal interface over the serial port with a minimal set of commands. To reduce the flash memory usage, you can define the compiler macro `ESP_CONSOLE_NOWIFI`. This will exclude Wi-Fi-specific code during compilation, saving space in the flash.


```cpp
#include "CxESPConsole.hpp"

CxESPConsole ESPConsole(Serial, "Test App", "1.0");

void setup() {
   Serial.begin(115200);
   ESPConsole.begin();
}

void loop() {
   ESPConsole.loop();
}
```

[ESPConsole_min_wifi](https://github.com/ocfu/ESPConsole/tree/main/examples/ESPConsole_min_wifi)
This example offers the same command set as the previous one, but with added remote access capabilities. You can connect a terminal client (e.g., PuTTY) via the defined port 23 to access the same simple command-line terminal interface over the network.

```cpp
#include "CxESPConsole.hpp"

CxESPConsole ESPConsole(Serial, "Test App", "1.0");

WiFiServer server(23);

#ifndef STASSID
#define STASSID "your-ssid"
#define STAPSK "your-password"
#endif

const char* ssid = STASSID;
const char* password = STAPSK;

void setup() {
   Serial.begin(115200);
   WiFi.begin(STASSID, STAPSK);
    
    while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
       delay(500);
       Serial.print(".");
    }
    Serial.println("\nWiFi connected.");
    server.begin();
    
    ESPConsole.begin(server);
}

void loop() {
   ESPConsole.loop();
}
```
